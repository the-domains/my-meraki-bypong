"FLY ME TO THE MOON"

Working real late Saturday night.  
It's 3a.m. after my bath, wanted to dry my hair quick so I can rest soon. But when I walk by my window, I saw this very seductive moonlight. Can't help it, setup my iPhone camera gear and take a few shots. The song "Fly Me To The Moon" by Frank Sinatra automatic playing in my head. Here you go, "Fly Me To The Moon" shot.
